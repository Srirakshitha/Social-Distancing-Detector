# Social-Distancing-Detector
Social Distancing Dtector using Computer Vision
The pre-trained model used in Social Distancing is Detectron 2 is an open-source library for object detection and segmentation
Created by the Facebook AI Research team, popularly known as FAIR. 
Detectron 2 implements state of the art architectures like
Faster R CNN, Mask R CNN, and RetinaNet for solving different computer vision tasks.
This platform is now implemented in PyTorch
It has been used to rapidly design and train the next-generation pose detection models. Eg..AI camera system in facebookâ€™s Portal video-calling Device
The trained model can be plugged in using Tensor Flow lite in a AI based camera and can monitor social distancing.
